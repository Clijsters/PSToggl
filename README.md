PSToggl is a PowerShell module which lets you track your time with [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) in your PowerShell.  
It uses Toggl's [API v8](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/blob/master/toggl_api.md)

## Under heavy development

This module is under heavy development and not ready for production use (yet)

However, I want to give you an overview of what will come and how you can contribute.
