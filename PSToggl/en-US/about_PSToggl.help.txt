CONTRIBUTE
    How can I contribute?
    Go to the GitHub page of this project (https://github.com/Clijsters/PSToggl), create an issue or a pull request and feel happy.
    Please don't forget to test your code with pester!

    Can I reuse code of this module?
    Yes! It's completely Open Source. I would like to be mentioned as author if you reuse code of that project.

    Is this module "official"?
    No. Nothing here is "official", like made by Toggl or something. I just wrote it, because I love PowerShell and I love Toggl. (oh and REST APIs)

EXAMPLES
    Transferring work logs from Toggl to JIRA is as easy as:
    PS> foreach ($issue in (Get-JiraIssue -Query "assignee = currentUser()")) {
    >>    Get-TogglEntry | ? {$_.Description -like "*$($issue.key)*"} |
    >>    Add-JiraIssueWorklog -Issue $issue.key -Comment $_.description -TimeSpent $_.Minutes -DateStarted $_.start
    >> }

    And eventually it will be as easy as:
    PS> Get-TogglEntry | ? {$_Description -like "*homepage-123*"} | Add-JiraIssueWorklog -Issue "homepage-123"

    Start a new timer:
    PS> Start-TogglEntry -Description "Meeting with Paul"

    Stop the running timer:
    PS> Stop-TogglEntry

    Create a new Entry for the last 80 minutes:
    PS> New-TogglEntry -minutes 80 -stop [datetime]::Now -description "coding some cool stuff"

    Create a new project:
    PS> New-TogglProject "Cool project" -CustomerId 12345


    | Pipelines | pipelines | pipelines |

    Create a new project from a JIRA project:
    PS> Get-JiraProject "Test" | New-TogglProject -CustomerId 12345

    Get the project of the current running timer:
    PS> Get-TogglEntry -Current | Get-TogglProject

    Vice Versa / Get all timers for a project:
    PS> Get-TogglProject -Name "Website" | Get-TogglEntry

    Set all tags from a specific entry to the currently running one
    PS> Get-TogglEntry -Description "some website" | Get-TogglTag | Set-TogglEntry -Current
    #TODO: Set-CurrentTogglEntry ?


    Even more awesome pipeline stuff which will be implemented soon...

    PS> Get-TogglEntry | ConvertTo-ExcelCompatible | Export-XLSX #...
    And so on
